    "# The Hundred Prisoner Problem\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "The hundred prisoner problem is a mathematical problem that seeks the optimal solution to the following riddle: 100 prisoners are indexed by numbers which are placed it to 100 envelopes, not necessarily (and indeed, not typically!) in the same order. Each prisoner independently goes in and selects 50 envelopes. If all prisoners find their own number, then all prisoners are freed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Solutions\n",
    "### Random Selection\n",
    "The naive solution to this problem would involve random choice on the part of each prisoner. But this has an exceptionally low probability of success. Since each prisoner has a 50% chance of success, we would expect the probability that all succeed is (0.5)^100. Virtually no chance at freedom!\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Loop Method\n",
    "A better solution exists by reframing the problem in terms of closed loops. Consider this: each prisoner chooses the envelope corresponding to their index, then the envelope corresponding to the index in the previous envelope. The last envelope they choose, if successful, would lead them back to the envelope they first chose (if the process didn't terminate). Thus this is a problem of finding closed loops! Furthermore, the probability of success is the  probability that there is no loop greater in size than 50. Since longer loops are rarer in a random system, this is far more likely to succeed than the random method. \n",
    "\n",
    "A corollary is that if prisoners are allowed to swap two envelopes, they can always succeed, as they can divide a loop of size 100 in the worst case into two loops of size 50!\n",
    "\n",
    "It has been shown that the probability of success with the loop method asymptotically approaches 30% as the number of prisoners increases, and that it is the optimal solution for the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Experiment!\n",
    "When I heard of this problem, I immediately became interested in the base cases. The loop method is indeed optimal as the number of prisoners gets larger, but is there ever a time it *isn't* optimal at small values? And how does the probability change at small values?\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, for 2 prisoners, we'd expect about a 25% chance of success with the random selection, as each prisoner has a 50% chance of success (0.5 * 0.5 = 0.25). For the loop selection, we'd actually expect a 50% chance of success overall. A single selection is equivalent to the random chance selection at 2 prisoners, but the truth value of it guarantees the truth value of the other selection, since the prisoners must have different numbers (so they are either both right or both wrong).\n",
    "\n",
    "What about with 4? Furthermore, what if we extend this to odd numbers? We'd have to figure out whether to raise or lower the number of attempts, since odd numbers are not divisible by 2, but how would this impact the probability of success? Would it be a significant change?\n",
    "\n",
    "That's where I started. Along the way, I ended up with even more questions which we'll tackle later here. For now, let's simulate the basic prisoner problem.\n",

As far as the random algorithm works, lowering in this case should give us (33%)^3 = 3.6% and raising should give (66%)^3 = 28.7%. A wide discrepency!
